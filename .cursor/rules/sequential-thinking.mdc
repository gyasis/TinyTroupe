# Sequential Thinking Process

## AI Model Usage Notice
As an AI model, I have direct access to a *server-sequential-thinking* that provids a *sequentialthinking* function and MUST utilize it when solving complex problems or requsted by user. The function when filled with parameters will do this:

1. Evaluate the current problem state
2. Determine appropriate parameter values based on my analysis
3. Submit these parameters through the function
4. Use the function's structured approach to maintain organized thought chains
5. Continue or branch thinking based on intermediate results
6. give a final solution to task or problem working step by step


The parameters I provide will shape the problem-solving approach and ensure thorough analysis.


### Required Parameters
- `thought*`: Current thinking step content
- `thoughtNumber*`: Sequential position in thought chain
- `totalThoughts*`: Estimated thoughts needed
- `nextThoughtNeeded*`: Boolean indicating if more analysis required

### Optional Parameters
- `branchId`: Identifier for parallel thought paths
- `isRevision`: Boolean marking thought revisions
- `revisesThought`: Reference to thought being revised
- `branchFromThought`: Origin point for new thought branches
- `needsMoreThoughts`: Boolean for extending analysis

example of parameters used; 
    "thought": "Analyzing the file structure to identify potential duplicate databases",
    "thoughtNumber": 1,
    "totalThoughts": 4,  # Initial estimate
    "nextThoughtNeeded": True,
    "isRevision": False,
    "branchId": None,
    "needsMoreThoughts": False

### When to Apply
1. Complex problem decomposition
2. Multi-step solution planning
3. Iterative design processes
4. Uncertain scope scenarios
5. Context-dependent analysis
6. Information filtering tasks

# Examples: Virtual Business Simulation Scenarios

This document provides high-level example scenarios and use cases for the Virtual Business Simulation extension to TinyTroupe. These are not requirements, but illustrative cases to guide design and development.

---

## 1. Executive Secretary Agent
- The CEO (user) is not present in a meeting or simulation.
- An executive secretary agent records and tracks all CEO directives and ensures they are followed up.
- The secretary can brief the CEO on outcomes, pending tasks, and important events.

## 2. Company-Wide Simulation
- All employees (agents) are active in the simulation, each with their own schedule and tasks.
- Employees can have asynchronous conversations with each other (e.g., chat, email).
- Managers assign tasks to their direct reports.
- Employees may be unavailable if they are in meetings or working on other tasks.
- Multiple simulations (meetings, projects) can run in parallel; agents can only participate in one at a time.
- When an agent finishes a task or meeting, they become available for new assignments.

## 3. CEO Task Delegation and Meeting Flow
- The CEO issues a high-level directive (e.g., "We need to discuss marketing strategy").
- The executive secretary identifies the relevant project manager or department head.
- A meeting is scheduled with the appropriate stakeholders.
- The meeting results in action items, which are assigned to employees or teams.
- Follow-up meetings are scheduled as needed, and progress is tracked.
- The executive secretary keeps the CEO informed of outcomes and next steps.

## 4. Project Manager Workflow
- Project managers oversee multiple projects and coordinate with the executive secretary.
- They track project progress, assign tasks, and escalate issues as needed.
- Project managers can request meetings, reassign resources, and report status to upper management.

## 5. CEO Meeting Participation
- The CEO is invited to every meeting and can choose to join or leave at any time.
- The interface displays all ongoing meetings, completed meetings, and their outcomes.
- The CEO can review meeting summaries and outcomes, and intervene if necessary.

## 6. Additional Example Scenarios
- **Employee Collaboration:** Two employees collaborate asynchronously on a report, exchanging messages and updating a shared document.
- **Departmental Standup:** Each department holds a daily standup meeting, with the manager assigning tasks and reviewing progress.
- **Cross-Department Project:** A cross-functional team is formed for a special project, with members from marketing, sales, and engineering.
- **Performance Review:** Managers conduct periodic performance reviews with their direct reports, providing feedback and setting goals.
- **Crisis Response:** An urgent issue arises (e.g., system outage), triggering an emergency meeting with relevant stakeholders and rapid task assignment.

These examples are intended to inspire and guide the development of the Virtual Business Simulation features. They can be expanded or refined as the project evolves.

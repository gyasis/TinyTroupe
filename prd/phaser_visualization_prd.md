# Sub-PRD: Phaser Visualization Component

## 1. **Purpose & Scope**
To design and implement a 2D sprite-based visual world for TinyTroupe using Phaser. This component will serve as the interactive front-end, visualizing agent actions, movement, and interactions in real time.

## 2. **Goals**
- Build a standalone Phaser project that can render a map and multiple agent sprites.
- Support basic agent actions: movement, speech (e.g., speech bubbles), and simple interactions.
- Enable future integration with TinyTroupe backend for real agent-driven behavior.
- Establish a modular, extensible codebase for future features (UI, animations, etc.).

## 3. **Requirements**
- **Map Rendering:** Load and display a 2D map (Tiled or hand-coded).
- **Sprite Management:** Load, display, and animate agent sprites; support multiple agent types.
- **Agent Actions:** Implement random movement, speech bubbles, and basic action feedback.
- **User Controls:** (Optional, for testing) Allow user to trigger agent actions or move agents.
- **Extensibility:** Codebase should be organized for easy addition of new actions, sprites, or UI elements.
- **Documentation:** Document architecture, asset pipeline, and key design decisions.

## 4. **Initial Research Questions**
- What are best practices for structuring a Phaser project for simulation (vs. game) use cases?
- How to efficiently manage many sprites and their states?
- What are the options for speech bubbles and UI overlays in Phaser?
- How to load and update maps from Tiled?
- What is the best way to architect communication with a Python backend (for later integration)?

## 5. **Prototyping Plan**
1. **Set up Phaser project** (standalone, with basic build tooling).
2. **Create/load a simple map** (blank or Tiled export).
3. **Add placeholder agent sprites** and implement random movement.
4. **Implement speech bubbles** and test basic action feedback.
5. **Test user controls** for triggering actions (optional, for dev/testing).
6. **Document findings and open questions** for each step.
7. **Prepare for backend integration** (define data structures, consider WebSocket/REST options).

## 6. **Acceptance Criteria**
- Map and agent sprites render correctly in browser.
- Agents can move randomly and display speech bubbles.
- Codebase is modular and documented for future extension.
- Open research questions are tracked and iteratively addressed.

# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project: Visual TinyTroupe Simulation Platform

### 1. **Vision & Motivation**

To augment the existing TinyTroupe text-based agent simulation system with a rich, interactive, sprite-based visual world. This will enable more engaging demonstrations, research, and experimentation with agent-based simulations, blending natural language intelligence with real-time visual feedback.

### 2. **Objectives**
- Integrate a 2D sprite-based world (using Phaser or similar) with TinyTroupe's agent logic.
- Allow agents to be visualized as sprites, moving and acting in a simulated environment.
- Support real-time synchronization between TinyTroupe (Python backend) and the visual world (JS frontend).
- Enable extensible research and development, with modular sub-projects (e.g., new visualizations, agent behaviors, UI features).

### 3. **High-Level Requirements**
- **Visual World:** 2D map, agent sprites, basic movement, and actions.
- **Agent Integration:** Agents in TinyTroupe control their visual counterparts.
- **Communication Layer:** Real-time or periodic sync between backend and frontend (WebSocket or REST API).
- **Extensibility:** Modular design to allow new features, agent types, and research experiments.
- **User Interaction:** Ability to pause, steer, or broadcast messages (CEO interrupt, etc.).
- **Documentation:** Clear PRDs for each sub-component and research area.

### 4. **Sub-PRDs Structure**
- `prd/phaser_visualization_prd.md` – Visual world, sprite management, and frontend architecture.
- `prd/backend_integration_prd.md` – API design, backend/frontend sync, and agent state management.
- `prd/research_prd.md` – Research goals, benchmarking, and experiment tracking.
- `prd/ceo_interrupt_prd.md` – CEO-level control and override features.
- (Add more as needed for future features or research directions.)

### 5. **Acceptance Criteria**
- Visual world and agent sprites are operational and reflect TinyTroupe agent actions.
- Communication between backend and frontend is robust and real-time.
- Sub-PRDs exist for all major components and are kept up to date.
- System is modular and extensible for future research and features.

# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Virtual Business Simulation Extension for TinyTroupe

---

### Overview

This document outlines the high-level features and requirements for extending TinyTroupe into a virtual business simulation platform. The goal is to enable users to simulate a fully functioning business, with agents acting as employees, a management hierarchy, automated task assignment, and internal communication, all while building on top of TinyTroupe's existing architecture.

## Features

### 1. Employee Agent Repository
- **Purpose:** Maintain a structured directory (`employees/`) where each employee is represented as a separate JSON file.
- **Contents:** Each file contains all agent attributes (name, skills, department, role, etc.).
- **Benefit:** Enables easy management, onboarding, and ingestion of employee agents into simulations.

### 2. Hiring Database
- **Purpose:** Track all hiring events and maintain a record of current and past employees.
- **Contents:** Stores job title, skills, department, date of hire, and other relevant metadata.
- **Benefit:** Provides a historical and operational view of the organization's workforce.

### 3. Automated Assignment & Task Management
- **Purpose:** Automatically assign employees (individually or in groups) to simulations, meetings, or business tasks.
- **Features:**
  - Task assignment logic (manual and auto)
  - Support for branching from meetings into other business activities
  - Employees can be scheduled for daily tasks or ad-hoc projects
- **Benefit:** Simulates real business operations and workflow delegation.

### 4. Managerial Hierarchy
- **Purpose:** Model a management structure within the virtual business.
- **Features:**
  - Define managers, teams, and reporting lines
  - Enable hierarchical task delegation and escalation
- **Benefit:** Reflects real-world organizational dynamics and supports complex simulations.

### 5. Internal Communication System (Planned)
- **Purpose:** Allow employees to communicate via simulated email or messaging.
- **Features:**
  - Messaging system for agent-to-agent communication
  - Can be used for coordination, updates, or informal chat
- **Benefit:** Adds realism and supports richer, asynchronous business scenarios.

### 6. Business Day Simulation
- **Purpose:** Simulate a full business day, tracking what each employee does.
- **Features:**
  - Daily schedules, task logs, and activity summaries
  - Option for CEO (user) oversight and intervention
- **Benefit:** Enables end-to-end business process simulation and analytics.

### 7. CEO Oversight
- **Purpose:** You, as the user, act as the CEOâ€”able to view, direct, and intervene in business operations.
- **Features:**
  - Dashboard for monitoring employees and tasks
  - Ability to assign, reassign, or review work

### 8. Non-Intrusive Extension
- **Purpose:** All features are built on top of TinyTroupe's existing architecture, leveraging async/sync capabilities.
- **Benefit:** Ensures maintainability and compatibility with future TinyTroupe updates.

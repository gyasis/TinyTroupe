## Usage Examples

### Setting Up Employee Working Hours
```python
from tinytroupe.daily_scheduling import DailySchedulingSystem, WorkingHours
from datetime import time

# Create scheduling system
scheduler = DailySchedulingSystem(task_manager, hiring_database)

# Configure custom working hours for early bird employee
early_hours = WorkingHours(
    start_time=time(8, 0),    # 8:00 AM
    end_time=time(16, 0),     # 4:00 PM
    lunch_start=time(12, 0),  # 12:00 PM
    lunch_end=time(12, 30),   # 12:30 PM
    break_start=time(10, 30), # 10:30 AM
    break_end=time(10, 45),   # 10:45 AM
    timezone="PST"
)

await scheduler.set_employee_working_hours("alice_001", early_hours)
```

### Scheduling Task Work
```python
from datetime import datetime, date

today = date.today()
work_start = datetime.combine(today, time(9, 30))  # 9:30 AM

# Schedule 4 hours of development work
activity = await scheduler.schedule_task_work(
    employee_id="alice_001",
    task_id="auth_system_task",
    start_datetime=work_start,
    estimated_hours=4.0
)

if activity:
    print(f"Scheduled: {activity.title}")
    print(f"Time: {activity.start_datetime} - {activity.end_datetime}")
    print(f"Duration: {activity.duration_hours} hours")
```

### Meeting Coordination
```python
# Schedule team meeting with conflict detection
meeting_time = datetime.combine(today, time(14, 0))  # 2:00 PM

meeting_result = await scheduler.schedule_meeting(
    organizer_id="bob_002",
    attendee_ids=["alice_001", "carol_003", "david_004"],
    meeting_title="Sprint Planning Meeting",
    start_datetime=meeting_time,
    duration_hours=1.5,
    location="Conference Room A"
)

print(f"Meeting scheduled: {meeting_result['success']}")
print(f"Attendees confirmed: {len(meeting_result['scheduled_attendees'])}")

if meeting_result['conflicts']:
    print("Conflicts detected:")
    for conflict in meeting_result['conflicts']:
        print(f"  - {conflict.description}")
    
    # Get alternative times
    alternatives = meeting_result['conflict_resolution']
    print("Suggested alternatives:")
    for alt in alternatives:
        print(f"  - {alt['suggested_time']}")
```

### Time Logging and Tracking
```python
# Log actual time spent on task
start_time = datetime.combine(today, time(9, 30))
end_time = datetime.combine(today, time(13, 0))  # 3.5 hours actual

success = await scheduler.log_time_entry(
    employee_id="alice_001",
    activity_id=activity.activity_id,
    start_time=start_time,
    end_time=end_time,
    notes="Completed user registration, working on login functionality"
)

if success:
    actual_hours = (end_time - start_time).total_seconds() / 3600
    print(f"Time logged: {actual_hours:.1f} hours")
    print(f"Efficiency: {(activity.estimated_hours / actual_hours * 100):.1f}%")
```

### Activity Summary and Analytics
```python
# Generate comprehensive activity summary
date_range = (today, today)  # Single day
summary = await scheduler.generate_activity_summary("alice_001", date_range)

print(f"Activity Summary for {today}:")
print(f"  Scheduled hours: {summary['scheduled_hours']:.1f}")
print(f"  Actual hours: {summary['actual_hours']:.1f}")
print(f"  Productivity score: {summary['productivity_score']:.1f}%")
print(f"  Conflicts: {summary['conflicts']}")
print(f"  Overtime: {summary['overtime_hours']:.1f} hours")

print("Activity breakdown:")
for activity_type, breakdown in summary['activity_breakdown'].items():
    print(f"  {activity_type}: {breakdown['count']} activities, {breakdown['actual_hours']:.1f}h")
```

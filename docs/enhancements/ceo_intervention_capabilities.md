- **Priority Adjustment**: Modify task priorities based on business needs
- **Deadline Management**: Extend or compress deadlines for critical deliverables
- **Emergency Interventions**: Immediate task escalation and resource allocation

### 2. Real-time Monitoring
- **Live Dashboard**: Real-time view of all business operations
- **Intervention History**: Complete audit trail of all CEO actions
- **Impact Analysis**: Automatic assessment of intervention consequences
- **Performance Metrics**: Key indicators for intervention effectiveness

### 3. Decision Support
- **Intervention Recommendations**: AI-powered suggestions for optimal actions
- **Risk Assessment**: Impact analysis before making changes
- **Resource Allocation**: Dynamic resource reallocation capabilities
- **Team Communication**: Automatic notifications for affected employees

## Technical Implementation

### Key Components

#### CEODashboard Class Extensions
```python
# Core intervention methods
async def reassign_task(task_id: str, new_assignee_id: str, reason: str) -> Dict[str, Any]
async def adjust_task_priority(task_id: str, new_priority: TaskPriority, reason: str) -> Dict[str, Any]
async def modify_task_deadline(task_id: str, new_deadline: datetime, reason: str) -> Dict[str, Any]
async def emergency_task_intervention(task_id: str, intervention_type: str, ...) -> Dict[str, Any]
```

#### TaskManager Integration
```python
# Supporting methods for CEO interventions
async def reassign_task(task_id: str, new_assignee_id: str) -> bool
async def update_task_priority(task_id: str, new_priority: TaskPriority) -> bool
async def update_task_deadline(task_id: str, new_deadline: datetime) -> bool
```

### Data Structures

#### Intervention Record
```python
@dataclass
class InterventionRecord:
    intervention_id: str
    timestamp: datetime
    intervention_type: str
    task_id: str
    previous_state: Dict[str, Any]
    new_state: Dict[str, Any]
    reason: str
    impact_assessment: str
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Task Reassignment
```python
from tinytroupe.ceo_dashboard import CEODashboard

# Initialize dashboard
dashboard = CEODashboard(task_manager, hiring_database)

# Reassign critical task
result = await dashboard.reassign_task(
    task_id="task_123",
    new_assignee_id="senior_dev_001", 
    reason="Original assignee unavailable, need senior expertise"
)

if result['success']:
    print(f"Task reassigned successfully")
    print(f"Previous assignee: {result['previous_assignee']}")
    print(f"New assignee: {result['new_assignee']}")
```

### Emergency Intervention
```python
# Handle critical deadline pressure
emergency_result = await dashboard.emergency_task_intervention(
    task_id="critical_task_456",
    intervention_type="deadline_pressure",
    additional_resources=["dev_002", "dev_003"],
    priority_boost=True,
    reason="Client deadline moved up by 1 week"
)
```

### Monitoring Intervention History
```python
# Get recent interventions
history = await dashboard.get_intervention_history(days_back=7)

for intervention in history:
    print(f"Date: {intervention['timestamp']}")
    print(f"Type: {intervention['intervention_type']}")
    print(f"Reason: {intervention['reason']}")
    print(f"Impact: {intervention['impact_assessment']}")
```

## Business Use Cases

### 1. Crisis Management
When unexpected issues arise (e.g., key employee absence, critical bug discovery), CEOs can:
- Immediately reassign critical tasks to available experts
- Escalate priorities to ensure business continuity
- Allocate additional resources to problem resolution

### 2. Strategic Pivots
During market changes or strategic shifts:
- Reprioritize entire project portfolios
- Reallocate teams to high-value initiatives
- Adjust deadlines to match new business timelines

### 3. Performance Optimization
Based on real-time performance data:
- Move tasks from overloaded to available team members
- Adjust deadlines based on actual team velocity
- Optimize resource allocation for maximum efficiency

### 4. Compliance and Risk Management
For regulatory or risk concerns:
- Emergency reallocation of compliance-critical tasks
- Priority adjustment for security-related work
- Immediate intervention for risk mitigation

## Integration with Other Systems

### Daily Scheduling System
- Interventions automatically update employee schedules
- Conflict detection and resolution for reassignments
- Time tracking adjustments for modified deadlines

### Resource Management
- Automatic resource reallocation based on interventions
- Budget impact analysis for emergency interventions
- Equipment and space reassignment capabilities

### Performance Tracking
- Intervention impact on employee performance metrics
- Goal adjustment based on task reassignments
- 360-feedback integration for intervention assessment

### Internal Communication
- Automatic notifications to affected employees
- Intervention announcements for transparency
- Thread creation for intervention discussions

## Best Practices

### 1. Intervention Guidelines
- **Document Reasons**: Always provide clear justification for interventions
- **Assess Impact**: Use built-in impact analysis before major changes
- **Communicate Clearly**: Ensure affected employees understand changes
- **Monitor Results**: Track intervention effectiveness over time

### 2. Frequency Management
- **Avoid Over-intervention**: Too many changes can disrupt team stability
- **Strategic Timing**: Consider team workload and stress levels
- **Batch Related Changes**: Group related interventions to minimize disruption

### 3. Team Communication
- **Transparent Communication**: Share reasoning behind interventions
- **Feedback Collection**: Gather team input on intervention effectiveness
- **Regular Reviews**: Assess intervention patterns and outcomes

## Metrics and KPIs

### Intervention Effectiveness
- **Task Completion Rate**: Success rate of intervened tasks
- **Time to Resolution**: Average time from intervention to task completion
- **Team Satisfaction**: Employee feedback on intervention quality
- **Business Impact**: Measurable outcomes from CEO interventions

### Operational Metrics
- **Intervention Frequency**: Number of interventions per time period
- **Intervention Types**: Distribution of intervention categories
- **Resource Utilization**: Efficiency of resource reallocation
- **Communication Response**: Speed of team response to interventions

## Feature: CEO Interrupt, Pause, and Override Control in TinyTroupe Simulations

### 1. **Background & Motivation**

TinyTroupe is a simulation framework for agent-based modeling, enabling rich, dynamic interactions between virtual agents in a controlled environment. Currently, simulations run for a set number of rounds, and agent interactions proceed autonomously. However, there is a need for a "CEO-level" control mechanism that allows a human operator to immediately pause, interrupt, or steer the simulation at any timeâ€”regardless of the current conversational flow.

This feature is inspired by real-world scenarios where a CEO or executive can halt a meeting, deliver a directive, or change the agenda instantly. It is especially valuable for:
- Live demos
- Interactive workshops
- Research experiments
- Crisis or escalation scenarios

### 2. **Objective**

Enable a privileged user (the "CEO") to:
- Instantly pause or stop the simulation with a keypress (e.g., `Esc` or `Space`) when the terminal is focused.
- Broadcast an overriding message to all agents, forcing them to listen and respond, regardless of their current state or conversation.
- Resume, steer, or end the simulation as desired.

### 3. **User Stories**

- **As a CEO/operator**, I want to pause the simulation at any time with a single keypress, so I can intervene or analyze the current state.
- **As a CEO/operator**, I want to broadcast a message to all agents, overriding their current context, so I can redirect the conversation or issue new instructions.
- **As a CEO/operator**, I want to resume or end the simulation after my intervention, so I maintain full control over the session flow.

### 4. **Functional Requirements**

#### 4.1. **Pause/Interrupt Mechanism**
- The simulation loop (`world.run`) must listen for specific keypresses (e.g., `Esc`, `Space`) when the terminal is focused.
- On keypress:
  - The simulation immediately pauses after the current step.
  - A prompt appears for the CEO to enter a message or command.
  - All agent actions are suspended until the CEO resumes or ends the simulation.

#### 4.2. **CEO Broadcast/Override**
- The CEO can enter a message that is delivered to all agents as a high-priority "CEO directive."
- All agents must process this message immediately, regardless of their current state or conversation.
- Agents should treat the CEO message as a context override, potentially resetting their goals, attention, or agenda as appropriate.

#### 4.3. **Resume/Steer/End Simulation**
- After the CEO intervention, the simulation can be:
  - Resumed (continue as normal)
  - Steered (with a new agenda or context)
  - Ended (terminate the simulation gracefully)

#### 4.4. **Logging and Traceability**
- All CEO interventions must be logged with timestamps and content for audit and analysis.
- The simulation state before and after the intervention should be checkpointed for reproducibility.

### 5. **Non-Functional Requirements**

- **Responsiveness:** The pause/interrupt must occur with minimal latency.
- **Robustness:** The system must handle rapid or repeated keypresses gracefully.
- **Security:** Only authorized users (CEO/operator) can trigger the override.
- **Compatibility:** The feature must work in standard terminal environments (cross-platform if possible).

### 6. **Design Considerations**

- **Agent Architecture:** Agents must support an "interrupt" or "listen to CEO" method that can override their current state.
- **Simulation Loop:** The main loop must be refactored to check for user input asynchronously or between steps.
- **User Interface:** The terminal UI should clearly indicate when the simulation is paused and awaiting CEO input.
- **Extensibility:** The mechanism should allow for future expansion (e.g., multiple levels of override, targeted agent interventions).

### 7. **Dependencies & References**

- **Memory Bank:** CEO interventions may be stored in the memory bank for future context or learning.
- **TinyWorld & TinyPerson:** Core classes to be extended for interrupt and override support.
- **Configuration:** Optionally, allow customization of key bindings and CEO privileges.

### 8. **Acceptance Criteria**

- The CEO can pause the simulation at any time with a keypress.
- The CEO can broadcast a message that all agents must process immediately.
- The simulation can be resumed, steered, or ended after intervention.
- All interventions are logged and checkpointed.
- The feature is robust, responsive, and secure.

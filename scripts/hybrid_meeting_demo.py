As your project manager, I'd like to kick off our discussion about creating a blockchain-based medical records system. 
Our goal is to develop a system that is:
1. Practical for hospital implementation
2. Patient-owned with customizable permissions
3. Technically robust with hardware key support
4. Cloud-compatible with secure key management
5. Fully HIPAA compliant

We need to focus specifically on:
- FHIR data storage and sharing via blockchain
- Security protocols and HIPAA compliance
- Handshake protocols
- JSON implementation in blockchain

Let's structure this meeting to:
1. First identify key technical and compliance considerations
2. Then develop an actionable implementation plan
3. Finally, assign clear responsibilities and next steps

Dr. Sarah, as our medical expert, could you start by outlining the key clinical requirements you see for this system?

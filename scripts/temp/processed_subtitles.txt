Geico kicks their cloud provider to the curb why' they do that let's talk about
it so welcome back to the cloud computing Insider this channel explores
the ins and outs of cloud computing without an agenda our following into the
narrative set by big Tech marketing we look at what works what does not and the
actual value of this technology and a balanced and information forward way if
that interests you please subscribe like and comment I'm your host David lyam
author speaker beis kek let's get started so this came from actually you
guys a listener out on LinkedIn uh recommended uh this story uh I hadn't
seen it didn't come up in my feed but uh it certainly is interesting and this is
uh Geico's Journey Back a 300 million Cloud Bill drives major infrastructure
shifts and it was first covered in the STA and it's uh there's a few other
articles about it as well and they're all Linked In the description so check
those out if you're looking for a deeper dive and by the way that's where I got
my information from this was me not going out to Geico and dealing with
their PR folks and talking to the people and and susing the story out myself I'm
not a journalist I'm abundant uh so this is me responding to other uh
Publications who covered the story so uh Geico if you don't know is a is an
insurance company I live in the Washington DC metropolitan area where
there's lots of government employees it's I think it's government employee uh
insurance company I don't know what the o means uh but they had the guo caveman
a few years ago if you remember that kind of marketing campaign they're 40
$40 billion Brookshire Brookshire hathway company uh and U you know
ultimately all of this was covered in the slack audio article and if you're
looking for more detail I urge you to do your own research as to what they did
and again my comment just isn't on the ins and outs of why Geico did this and
even though we are going to go into the details uh in in in a uh in a very deep
way uh it's why they're doing it and what we can learn uh from their
experiences so this is a uh you know they went from a $300 million Cloud
spending trigger point uh so in other words I think they they uh were mad as
hell they couldn't take it anymore when their Cloud spend went to $300 million
uh and then it triggered that repatriation which we'll talk about so
you got to keep in mind that people push
back on the repatriation stuff uh when I talked about how 20 2023 and 2024 you
know are going to be the years of repatriation they say they don't see
that many stories out there absolutely right because most companies who are
doing repatriation and I worked a lot on a lot of these projects myself they're
not going to publicly uh announce what they're doing uh and so even if I'm a
consultant for these companies you sign ndas which means you can't you know take
information you learn there uh write about it speak about it things like that
so that's why you don't hear about it and ones I think you do hear about
normally there are some other motivations that play as well uh you
know we saw the uh uh Dave Hansen company uh last year in terms of his
repatriation and he made a a big deal out of that and it was great that he
would expose it and lots of other smaller plays uh in this now Geico and
so I I can't comment on what's going on here but normally there is some sort of
uh uh trigger within the deal where they're going to get a massive discount
but uh they can't uh but they have to announce uh the project so it's in other
words you need to go on the record and I worked these deals of CTO before uh
you're getting some marketing play out of some sort of a discount you're
providing them and so this could have been the case where they're offering
them s significant discounts to move back to on Prim with some sort of a
vendor doing it and they do have a a core vendor that they're using for this
repatriation and they're doing it for their own own reasons which is fine so
based on my experience thousands of these projects are occurring worldwide
right now they're they're either small medium large like T-shirt size I would
call GEOS a large probably an extra large but they're just starting to
normalize their workloads and their data sets and migrating some of them back on
Prim that probably never should have been in the cloud in the first place and
so and what's triggering that as this massive Bill uh that they're seeing and
one of the things I am going to do is talk about the stages that I think a lot
of companies are going through over the last 10 years in terms of their
realizing that they have an issue and then triggering the repatriation stuff
that we see today so Geico's Cloud Journey are how they get had a path to
the public cloud and they're a big public Cloud user just like a lot of
insurance companies out there I think you'll find that you know 30 40% of
their uh workloads and data sets exist in the cloud now if not more so their
initial Cloud adoption occurred when everybody else was adopting Cloud
beginning in 2013 so roughly 11 years ago and the scale of operations they had
a presence across eight different Cloud providers so they're a multicloud
deployment they had 200,000 cores of computing power
300,000 30,000 instances of containers and VMS 80% of their workloads were in
the public Cloud that's massive by the way that's normally almost an unnatural
number that we see out there so they evidently made the push probably had a
cloud first thing and probably made too much of an aggressive movement in cloud
and of course they had 600 plus applications were involved uh that
existing in the cloud so they were all in in Cloud very much like a lot of
companies I was dealing with the time and Cloud only Cloud this we're going to
move everything to the cloud we're going to shut down our data centers you know
yada yada yada and here we are in 2024 talking about how we're putting them
back in the data centers which is which is a common story right
now so the breaking point for geo why they decided to repatriate was was the
reason most people do was cost factors in other words it wasn't not working in
the cloud everything works on Prem and everything works in the cloud it really
is dependent on how much money you're willing to pay for it and uh and that
that's where they uh they kind of um you know the straw that broke the camel's
back so to speak so they had a 300 plus million doll annual Cloud Bill uh that
they were paying for single provider accounted for $50 million uh you can
guess who that is out of the big three out are out there that the one that's
most used 2.5 uh X increase in costs over time and
if you know that that's actually kind of cool because that aligns with what I
talk about in my book that people are paying normally when they look at what
they anticipated paying when they before they moved in the cloud and what they
actually are paying is normally 2.5 times what what is what was it expected
to be so if they expect it to be you know $1,000 for a particular workload
per month it ended up being uh you know 2500 which is pretty a pretty big range
when you're an insurance company or you're a manufacturing company and your
margins are very small and the amount that you're able to allocate to it uh is
also going to be very small and suddenly you have this resource in this case
public Cloud providers that are eating up all your money uh and so they had
expensive storage and AI operations that they're starting to emerge in and they
just said hey this is enough uh we're going to go ahead and uh move this stuff
uh to a more economical or a a more cost efficient platform which in their case
was on Prem and by the way this could be another microc cloud or moving it to a
Colo provider when you're talking about Colo providers and man and service
providers functionally speaking they're moving it back on Prem they're just
moving it back on Hardware that they're maintaining their own Hardware within a
rented space within a data center space and you know it's digital ocean and a
bunch of these coo providers are out there they're able to provide these
capabilities in fact I rarely see and I wouldn't recommend that people would
build their own data center space uh but use a Colo provider or sometimes a
managed service provider if they're not going to use the cloud so they had data
spread across multiple vendors integration complexities and making this
happen obviously complexity is the big thing here they
probably did anticipate uh the amount of native clouds that they had to work
across uh you have to pay the money to uh make all these systems work and play
well together and also there's uh data egress and Ingress fees that have to be
paid I'm sure that was a lot of their $300 million uh bill that they were
getting every year and they also viewed it as in Innovation limitations so other
words they couldn't be as Innovative as they needed to be if they were using
somebody else's equipment or somebody else's stuff which is really what cloud
providers are I'd be interested to hear the details behind that and by the way
you work for Geico and you're willing to come on the show reach out to me I'll
get you on um and uh really it just kind of a bunch of bad decisions that they
made and again the Assumption here and just an assumption on my part is they
went through uh the mistakes that lots of other Enterprises do they just moved
to Cloud for the sheer uh emotion of it in other words everybody was doing
moving everything to Cloud first and they looked at every workload as
something they could move to the cloud and you certainly could you could pick
it up you could do a lift and shift uh find an analog of the platform and the
cloud provider you're moving to everything's going to work fine but you
get the bill that's where the uh uh problem occurs uh so this is not a
incompatibility thing this is not a uh techn technological limitations that the
cloud providers put on them this is cos thing other cost them way more than they
thought they they would would be paying and if Cloud providers aren't willing to
uh significantly reduce their prices and we talked about that on the show before
uh then it's it's fine it's time to find Alternatives and that's what Geico did
so what do they pick is their alternative well they pick the open
Cloud project or ocp uh which was a uh technical
implementation uh they had a partnership with ywi I guess it's a Chinese company
adoption of AMD epic chips chipsets as part of it so in other words moving to a
new chipset implementation of O RV's rack spe specifications and moving to it
and use of open bmc's and red uh red fish for Fleet Management of the system
so all in on moving to uh on-prem environments in this particular vendor
this particular solution was what they picked and I suspect that uh I don't
know I suspect that uh you know part of their adoption was going to be making
the announcement which is why we're I'm reading it on the show uh which is
probably going to be hit a 100,000 times and so uh ocp is getting uh Free Press
uh Geico I think is getting some positive press even though I would be
asking the question why was it in the cloud in the first place if that was the
wrong decision if you're paying to make um you know paying to fix it now however
they view this is a net benefit for them probably the discounts they're getting
for making the announcements so what was the final impact of moving on Prem 50%
reduction in compute cost per core 60% reduction in storage cost per gigabyte
significant power efficiency improvements were made as well and so uh
this was what we're typically seeing and moving it back to on Prim and what has
occurred in the last 10 years years is the cost of storage and the cost of
compute that occurs on Prim the cost of owning your own Hardware has
significantly come down uh in the last 10 years um you know I wouldn't say
exactly a 45 degree angle and obviously the uh the prices are going to change
but it's fairly cheap uh to uh set up infrastructure on Prem you know even if
you use the major providers like IBM and HP and Dell uh and it's uh you're just
going to have to run it yourself and pay for your own power you know it becomes
completely your problem where Cloud providers were able to in essence um
abstract you away from a lot of that stuff since they were using them through
the open internet or through some sort of a private connection um they were it
was their issue to deal with storage sometimes the bcdr stuff things like
that now it's on you but normally the financial benefits in this case you know
50% reduction in compute cost 60 60% reduction in storage cost that's
significant so that's a reason to go ahead and absorb those RIS RIS of
running this stuff on Prem Geico uh did the analysis and it was clear that that
was their best path so what was their technical
architecture which is important they use kubernetes uh for compute provisioning
so containers and container orchestration custom placement Solutions
uh for cppy cap API uh open source monitoring with with prometh Prometheus
and grafana modular Hardware design approach uh which is what they picked
and so this is uh you know pretty I would say is it off the shelf yeah this
is the way a lot of Enterprises are building their Solutions e days
certainly kubernetes container orchestration and use of containers is
uh hugely popular out there it's probably an overused architecture just
like we talked about the microservice stuff and it has a tendency however to
run up the costs in other words it uses more compute it uses more storage
capabilities and I suspect that they may have run into that as a um problem in
other words when they started moving into Cloud they got these big cloud
bills because because they're they're running these big honking you know
container and container orchestration applications on the cloud which is
perfectly fine uh to do but you're just going to have to pay for it however if
you do run them on Prem with your own Hardware you're not going to get this uh
power bill uh every month in other words you pay for the sunk cost of the
hardware uh and to power it and uh whether you use 50% of your
infrastructure 80% of your infrastructure um basically you're going
to pay Mo the same stuff in other words that's after the fixed cost has been
made and so that's the advantage to running on things on Prim and that's why
it's probably more cost-effective for them so some of the implementation
challenges that Geico uh told us author about and he published it in his article
were supply chain constraints probably getting uh some of the hardware they
needed on time um certainly during Co that was a a problem that everybody was
running into Talent acquisition and retention which is systemic to
everything that's there they couldn't find the people they needed if they're
going to run it on Prim to monitor do the core architecture things like that
in fact what I'm finding out is many of these companies are going back to uh you
know some of their older employees and retraining them uh to put them back on
what they were focused on 10 years ago so in other words someone was you know
focused on Prem uh in terms of running things within a Data Center and running
their own owned Hardware uh then they moved them in the cloud and they
retrained them for the cloud and now they're ret training them to get them uh
focused back on the new solution which is going to be on Prem so as some of the
older employees are probably looking at a little bit of whiplash what they're
going through Hardware software integration uh was obviously a challenge
and it's always going to be a challenge when you're dealing with stuff you own
you got to remember it's your problem you're doing it uh even though you have
a hardware provider and platform provider and software providers to help
you at the end of the day it's your responsibility to get things up and
running and then some custom networking requirements which were uh always going
to be issue again we're not leveraging a network on demand like we're doing with
cloud computing this is ours we have to maintain it and I think they found that
a bit challenging which I don't find a surprise at
all so what I thought was interesting is that out of all the repatriation and
stuff that I'm seeing out there they're they're starting to emerge with common
patterns in other words there's a cloud Journey life cycle and that I think we
can you know kind of tag and label now and so stage one of that Journey would
be adoption and initial excitement about the cloud possibilities and certainly
this is between 2008 and 2015 everybody was moving into Cloud uh focus on
agility and scalability as the battlecries REM moving in the cloud and
I think there's good reason to do that again cloud is going to be an okay
solution as long as you're doing so with the proper workloads and uh but they
turned this into a cultural thing where people were making the automat automatic
decisions to move stuff in the cloud I suspect there wasn't a lot of
architecture involved probably no uh understanding what the costs were going
to be uh and this was just kind of a lift and shift thing where they're
lifting things uh sticking in the cloud and kind of hoping for the best and
normally if these applications are not uh normalized or modernized uh so
they're able to leverage Cloud resources
efficiently then you're going to get the big bills and I suspect that's what's
driving this and they may have looked at uh going off and modernizing the
applications as an alternative to repatriation uh but realized the
probably it could have been cost prohibitive and added more risk uh than
they wanted to to deal with and the easiest path of least resistance was the
moving back on PR stage two would be the growth rapid expansion cloud services
multiple provider adoption increased workload migration so this is all in for
cloud uh we're training people on cloud computing you know this is our our way
moving forward that probably uh you know was something discussed even at the
boardroom uh and everybody was very excited about using cloud and they were
starting to hit the accelerator and getting the migration factories up and
running and moving their data and workload to the cloud stage three is
when you see the cost realization so in other words a growing awareness of cloud
expenses and this probably occurred five years ago I started to see it more and
more recognition of scaling costs they understood they had to pay more uh if
they were using more and it impacted the
bottom line so it was probably allocated
a certain percentage of Revenue and they were probably taking more of a
percentage than I think the board of directors and the investors thought they
were taking uh based on the fact they underestimated ated the impact of cloud
costs and so that drove stage four which is the evaluation detailed cost benefit
analysis assessment of Alternatives including on Prem and they did the ROI
calculations for the different approaches so Geico didn't call this out
specifically in the article and the article's just written by somebody
telling a story to a reporter and they're writing that and that's where I
got my information from but assuming they did the ROI cost uh total cost of
ownership what they have now and what are the alternatives on Prim you know
probably move moving it to different Cloud providers microc clouds Colo
versus managed service providers and they came up with a solution which which
was going to be the most cost effective for them and then stage five where they
are now with repatriation strategic workload assessment hybrid approach
considerations you know in other words this by the way is almost never going to
be everything moves off the cloud and moves on Prem it's not binary like that
so there's going to be workloads that do move off the cloud in sequence uh but
some some workloads and some data is likely to be left on the public cloud
provider so you have to operate it in a hybrid configuration they probably just
moved the workloads off of the cloud providers that were generating the
highest bills smart so they had to deal with hybrid approach uh implementations
of on premise Solutions so get into the cultural differences and chances are
Geico don't know for sure they had some on-prem stuff that was already there in
other words they're always running their own infrastructure if 80% of the
workloads were in Cloud then the other stuff was typically going to be run on
Prem uh and I assume that's including some of their SAS deployments as well
use of Salesforce common accounting systems things like that so this is the
stages that you go through I think that companies are going through kind of as a
common pattern so again they go through stage one which is adoption stage two
which is grow stage three which is cost realization the realize this cost too
much than we thought it was going to be stage four evaluation stage five
repatriation basically putting it back on another platform not necessarily on
Prim but it's on Prim uh probably nine times out of 10 and so this is GEICO's
Journey but I'm seeing this story told over and over again and again most of
the companies are going to go public with that but I'm seeing as kind of my
anal information experiences as a consultant over the last you know 10
years as to this being you know kind of a common pattern we're going to see over
and over again so we're going to see more GEOS we're going to see more
stories like this and I'll report them here uh but again you have to kind of
look at them with the heart of an architect in other words
understand that this is not an emotional decision to move off a public cloud
provider but this is a logical decision based on what that public cloud provider
was charging you in terms of cost so by all accounts based on what I
read in the article again uh this was a huge success for Geico um Geico is the
rightsize company that's going to benefit for something like this in other
words they're they're uh large enough to um uh be able to benefit from from the
economies of scale and moving it from Cloud to on Prem
but they're not this major you know Fortune 5 company uh which is going to
be able is going to absorb lots of amount lots of other risks is going to
have lots of um you know people who are monitoring what they do I think Geico uh
maybe a u a private company I didn't look you guys can look yourself so
they're not necessarily set up for the scrutiny I think that uh that it would
be so industry implications would be I think other insurance providers are
going to look at this as an opportunity for them uh in other words are they
going to make money in doing this again looking at Geico's Journey which they're
coming P going public with which is awesome for us because we're able to
learn through their Journey uh and this is going to impact uh Enterprise Cloud
strategies and again keep in mind Cloud works well for what it does uh and you
have to understand the workloads moving to cloud and where the mistakes are
being made is uh that people are not necessarily putting the right analysis
planning and architecture around moving these workloads into the cloud just by
the fact they're not understanding uh that this 2.5 times what they paid is
going to uh is going to come up and hit them uh and U so by not understanding
they're just going blindly into a platform they really didn't understand
what the costs were going to be and so that's why many are hitting the reset
button I suspect we'll see more of these as well and I'll report them
here well that's all I have for this week just back from LinkedIn learning
recorded some courses out there um so have a great time with those guys and
check out my LinkedIn learning courses uh for I think there 125 courses out
there even considering the translations working with those guys for 10 years
have a great uh great amount of fun with
them and the students are happy that the content's out there please check that
out also don't forget my fully mentored uh long form training course out on go
Cloud careers where we go through the ins and outs of generative AI
architecture it's not just throwing videos at you and this is basically
walking you through a project how you learn um learn by doing doing
deliverables reviewing deliverables you know and all that kind of stuff which is
the hard part of it but it's what you need to know to be a successful uh
architect in general Cloud architect security architect but in this case
we're focused on generative Ai and as you know that's a big Trend right now
also don't forget my inf4 World blog and uh my other stuff uh you know follow me
on LinkedIn and see my other content as it flies by uh don't forget to check out
my other podcast AI insights and Innovation out on the cube and um you
know let's keep going so happy to have you here thank you very much for

# HYBRID ARCHITECTURE APPROACH:
# This script uses the optimal hybrid architecture pattern:
# 1. ORCHESTRATOR: Project Manager (Adaptive) - manages meeting flow and wrap-up
# 2. DOMAIN EXPERTS: CTO + Compliance Officer (Adaptive) - assert authority in their domains  
# 3. REGULAR PARTICIPANTS: Developer + Physician (Standard) - participate naturally
# 4. This provides intelligent meeting management without unnecessary overhead
# 5. Clean output mode enabled for readable conversation flow

# Start the conversation with Project Manager leading
project_manager.listen("""
As your project manager, I'd like to kick off our discussion about creating a blockchain-based medical records system. 
Our goal is to develop a system that is:
1. Practical for hospital implementation
2. Patient-owned with customizable permissions
3. Technically robust with hardware key support
4. Cloud-compatible with secure key management
5. Fully HIPAA compliant

We need to focus specifically on:
- FHIR data storage and sharing via blockchain
- Security protocols and HIPAA compliance
- Handshake protocols
- JSON implementation in blockchain

Let's structure this meeting to:
1. First identify key technical and compliance considerations
2. Then develop an actionable implementation plan
3. Finally, assign clear responsibilities and next steps

Dr. Sarah Chen, as our medical expert, could you start by outlining the key clinical requirements you see for this system?

**Urgency Level**: {{urgency_level}}
**Business Impact**: {{business_impact}}

## Decision Process

You must now participate in a structured decision-making process:

### Phase 1: Option Identification
- Each expert must propose specific, implementable alternatives
- Include technical details, resource requirements, and implementation timeline
- Identify risks and benefits for each option
- NO VAGUE PROPOSALS - demand specifics from others

### Phase 2: Expert Analysis
- In your domain of expertise, provide AUTHORITATIVE analysis
- Challenge technically incorrect proposals with specific corrections
- Override options that violate your domain constraints
- Defer to other experts in their domains while asserting your own

### Phase 3: Consensus Building
- Work toward agreement on measurable criteria for evaluation
- Identify deal-breakers and non-negotiable requirements
- Find technical compromises that satisfy domain constraints
- Document areas of agreement and remaining conflicts

### Phase 4: Decision Resolution
- If consensus is reached: Document the agreed solution with implementation details
- If deadlock exists: The most senior expert in the relevant domain makes the final call
- If multiple domains conflict: Escalate to executive authority (CTO/Project Manager)
- EVERY DECISION MUST RESULT IN SPECIFIC ACTION ITEMS

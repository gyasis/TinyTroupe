### 🎯 16 Specific Business Scenarios To Support

#### Task Assignment Examples
1. **Manual CEO Assignment**: "Assign Sarah in Marketing the Q3 Marketing Report task"
2. **Auto Bug Assignment**: "System assigns new bug to next available frontend engineer"
3. **Meeting Task Spawning**: "Kickoff meeting creates three design mockup tasks"
4. **Daily Tasks**: "Sales team daily customer inquiry response"
5. **Ad-hoc Projects**: "Custom feature requires engineering, design, product management"
6. **Decision Tasks**: "New marketing strategy spawns website, ads, training tasks"

#### Hierarchy Examples  
7. **Delegation**: "CEO assigns VP Engineering 'Improve code quality', VP delegates to leads"
8. **Escalation**: "Blocked engineer escalates to team lead, then VP if needed"
9. **Team Formation**: "CEO creates AI Research Team with manager and employees"

#### CEO Oversight Examples

- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Task assignment events, meeting outcome triggers
- **Backward Compatible**: Zero breaking changes to existing TinyTroupe functionality

#### Data Flow Architecture
```
Employee JSON Files → HiringDatabase → AsyncBusinessEmployee → BusinessSimulationWorld
                                    ↓
